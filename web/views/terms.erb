    <p><a name="4.1"></a><strong>4.1</strong> We may award credits, points or any of our other virtual currencies (each

      Acquisition of Promotional Credits provides only a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
      use such Promotional Credits to access Services that we expressly make available for use with the Promotional Credits.
      Promotional Credits have no monetary value and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Promotional Credits
      may not be sold or transferred, and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods or services, except for
      Services. We may cancel any Promotional Credits transferred, assigned or sold in violation of this Agreement.</p>

    <p><a name="4.2"></a><strong>4.2</strong> During the term of Your license to Promotional Credits, You have the right to

      that particular Services will be offered for any particular time.</p>

    <p><a name="4.3"></a><strong>4.3</strong> The term of Your Promotional Credits license starts when You acquire such
      Promotional Credits and, subject to this Agreement, expires upon the earlier of (a) twelve months from the date of
      award (as the context requires and applicable to each individual award); or (b) the date that Your access to the
      Services is expired, suspended, cancelled or terminated as set forth herein. If You do not use Your account for twelve
      months, or if You delete Your account, any remaining Promotional Credits may be redeemed, cancelled or expired by us.
      Once Promotional Credits are redeemed for Services, such Services are not returnable, exchangeable or refundable for
      Promotional Credits or any other virtual currency, or for cash or goods or services.</p>

    <p><a name="4.4"></a><strong>4.4</strong> Promotional Credits may only be held by legal residents of countries where
      access to and use of the Services and Promotional Credits are permitted. Promotional Credits may only be awarded by us
      or through means we provide on the Website or otherwise expressly authorize. We can cancel or suspend Your access to
      Promotional Credits in our sole discretion and without prior notice, if (a) You fail to comply with this Agreement; or
      (b) if we otherwise suspect fraud or misuse of Promotional Credits. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and
      will not reimburse You for, any Promotional Credits lost due to such cancellation or suspension.</p>

    <p><a name="4.5"></a><strong>4.5</strong> We have the absolute right to offer, manage, regulate, modify and/or eliminate

      giving You 30 days' advance notice. All fees payable by You are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including,
      without limitation, VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide such information to us as reasonably required to
      determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from You. You are responsible for any charges imposed on <%== $settings.name %> by
      a
      carrier related to government fees for telecommunications, including but not limited to, Universal Service Fund fees,

    <p><a name="5.3"></a><strong>5.3</strong> We may specify the manner in which You will pay any fees, and any such payment
      shall be subject to our general accounts receivable policies from time to time in effect. All amounts payable by You
      under this Agreement will be made without setoff or counterclaim and without deduction or withholding. If any
      deduction or withholding is required by applicable law, You shall notify us and shall pay such additional amounts to
      us as necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after such deduction and withholding, equals the amount
      we would have received if no such deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, You shall provide us with
      documentation that the withholding and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</p>

      forums and comments sections), Services, <%== $settings.name %> Properties, <%== $settings.name %> Marks, Your Application or Your Content in a
      manner
      that violates the Acceptable Use Policy. To this effect, we ask that You take reasonable precautions to promote best
      practices. Although <%== $settings.name %> does not assume the duty or obligation to monitor any materials created, posted or
      uploaded
      by You or any third parties, <%== $settings.name %> reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to monitor any and all
      materials posted or uploaded by You or any third parties at any time without prior notice to ensure that they conform
      to any usage guidelines or policies (including our Acceptable Use Policy) relating to our Website or Services.</p>

    <p><a name="7.2"></a><strong>7.2</strong> You also acknowledge and understand that we do NOT currently allow You to
      access any 911 or similar emergency services (no traditional 911, E911, or similar access to emergency services). The
      Services are not intended to replace any primary phone service, such as a traditional landline or mobile phone, that
      may be used to contact emergency services.</p>

    <p><a name="7.3"></a><strong>7.3</strong> You represent and warrant: (i) that You are solely responsible for the
      development, operation, and maintenance of Your Application and for Your Content, including without limitation, the
      accuracy, appropriateness and completeness of Your Content and all product-related materials and descriptions; (ii)
      that You have the necessary rights and licenses, consents, permissions, waivers and releases to use and display Your
      Application and Your Content; (iii) that neither Your Application nor Your Content (a) violates, misappropriates or
      infringes any rights of us or any third party, (b) constitutes defamation, invasion of privacy or publicity, or
      otherwise violates any rights of any third party, or (c) is designed for use in any illegal activity or promotes
      illegal activities, including, without limitation, in a manner that might be libelous or defamatory or otherwise
      malicious, illegal or harmful to any person or entity, or discriminatory based on race, sex, religion, nationality,
      disability, sexual orientation, or age; (iv) that neither Your Application nor Your Content contains any harmful
      components; and (v) to the extent to which You use any of the <%== $settings.name %> Marks, that You will conduct Your business in a
      professional manner and in a way that reflects favorably on the goodwill and reputation of <%== $settings.name %>. You also represent
      and warrant that You are responsible for any charges incurred by virtue of Your use of the Application, no matter
      whether the Application acted in error.</p>

    <p><a name="7.4"></a><strong>7.4</strong> You further understand and agree that You will have use of the telephone
      number(s) that are provided as part of the services only until the end of the term of Your Agreement with <%== $settings.name %> or
      until <%== $settings.name %> no longer provides You with Service. You understand and agree that <%== $settings.name %> is the customer of record for
      all telephone number(s) provided as part of the Services and, therefore, <%== $settings.name %> has certain rights with respect to
      porting of the number(s) (“Porting” is causing or attempting to cause number(s) to be transferred, switched, or
      otherwise moved to any other service provider, telephone carrier, or any other person or entity). As the customer of
      record for the telephone number(s), <%== $settings.name %> owns the telephone number(s) assigned to you. <%== $settings.name %> generally ports a
      telephone number at the request of a customer. <%== $settings.name %> reserves the right to refuse to port any telephone number(s) in
      its sole discretion.</p>

    <p><a name="7.4.1"></a><strong>7.4.1</strong> If You "ported in" any telephone number(s) in connection with Your use of
      Services, <%== $settings.name %> assigned You one or more toll free telephone numbers, You are entitled to "port out" a telephone
      number under non-U.S. law, or <%== $settings.name %> has agreed to port out any telephone number(s), You may "port out" such
      number(s) only if You satisfy the following requirements: (1) You provide written notice to <%== $settings.name %> of Your intent to
      "port out" such number(s) no later than thirty (30) days after providing <%== $settings.name %> notice of Your intent to terminate
      this Agreement (the "Porting Notice Period"); (2) Your new telephone carrier provides <%== $settings.name %>'s telephone carrier a
      duly executed porting request prior to the expiration of the Porting Notice Period; (3) You have paid <%== $settings.name %> for all
      Services provided to You prior to the date You provide <%== $settings.name %> notice of Your intent to terminate this Agreement; and
      (4) You have paid <%== $settings.name %> any administrative fees associated with processing the port. You hereby authorize <%== $settings.name %> to
      charge Your account in the applicable amount for the administrative fees in subsection (4) above or to otherwise
      arrange to make this payment to <%== $settings.name %> within the Porting Notice Period. The porting process can be lengthy; if You
      would like to maintain Your account with the company during the porting process, You must maintain Your account in an
      active status and not terminate Your account until the porting out is complete. Regardless of when the port out is
      complete, You will continue to be responsible to pay all applicable account fees with respect to the telephone numbers
      until You formally terminate this Agreement. If You fail to satisfy any of the foregoing requirements, <%== $settings.name %> remains
      the customer of record over the number(s) and You are expressly prohibited from causing or attempting to cause such
      number(s) to be transferred to any other service provider, telephone carrier or any other person or entity. <%== $settings.name %>
      also retains the right to reclaim the number(s) from You after the number(s) are ported out in contravention with
      these requirements and authorize <%== $settings.name %> to charge Your account or take any other measures to collect the costs
      associated with causing the number(s) to be returned to <%== $settings.name %>. You understand and agree that even if You satisfy the
      requirements set forth in this section, technical or procedural difficulties or interruptions may occur when
      attempting to port out these numbers and such difficulties or interruptions may prevent Your new carrier from porting
      the numbers. <%== $settings.name %> is not responsible for such technical or procedural difficulties or interruptions.</p>

    <p><a name="2.4.2"></a><strong>2.4.2</strong> You understand and agree that following the termination of this Agreement
      for any reason, your number(s) may be re-assigned to another customer. You agree that <%== $settings.name %> will not be liable for
      damages (including consequential or special damages) arising out of any such re-assignment and You hereby waive any
      claims with respect to any such re-assignment, whether based on contractual, tort or other grounds, even if <%== $settings.name %>
      has been advised of the possibility of damages.</p>

    <p><a name="2.4.3"></a><strong>2.4.3</strong> You understand and agree that <%== $settings.name %> may need to change the telephone
      number(s) assigned to You. You agree that <%== $settings.name %> will not be liable for damages (including consequential or special
      damages) arising out of any such change in the telephone number(s) assigned to You and You hereby waive any claims
      with respect to any such change, whether based on contractual, tort or other grounds, even if <%== $settings.name %> has been advised
      of the possibility of damages.</p>

    <p><a name="7.5"></a><strong>7.5</strong> You represent and warrant that You have read and understood the Acceptable Use
      Policy, Privacy Policy and General Terms and Conditions, and You agree to abide by their terms, where applicable,

      FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. YOU AND <%== $settings.name %> ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:</p>

    <p><a name="9.3.1"></a><strong>9.3.1</strong> THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. ANY DISPUTE THAT IN

    <p><a name="9.3.3"></a><strong>9.3.3</strong> THIS AGREEMENT DOESN'T ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE

      DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF YOU AND <%== $settings.name %> ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE

    <p><a name="9.3.5"></a><strong>9.3.5</strong> AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT
      SPECIFIC CASE; IT CAN'T BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.</p>

    <p><a name="9.3.6"></a><strong>9.3.6</strong> IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN
      SUBSECTION (3) CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.</p>

    <p><a name="9.3.7"></a><strong>9.3.7</strong> IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH
      ARBITRATION, YOU AND <%== $settings.name %> AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND <%== $settings.name %> UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY
      RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY
      WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. YOU
      AND <%== $settings.name %> ALSO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER SHALL BE ADJUDICATED IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO,
      CALIFORNIA, AND YOU CONSENT TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN SUCH COURTS.</p>
